This is an interactive web-program that can be utilized by various business to help speed up the cold-calling process. You simply need to input the category of business you are looking for, 
and the city/state and the program will print out 30 business corresponding to your search in an easy to read format. 

This is a web-scraping web api that utilizes the beautiful soup package to gather the information from the html of the yellow pages. Other websites can be used but require further use of sites 
like Bright Data to bypass the capchtas. For the sake of this program (and my own money not) I only included the free-to-scrape yellow page link. 

The program uses flask to implement html/css templates to make the site look pretty.
